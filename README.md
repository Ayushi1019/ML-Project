## Predicting-Depression-Symptoms
Predicting depression symptoms using chat messages from Discord client.

Millions of people suffer from depression, a chronic mental illness, every year. To identify the symptoms, mental health professionals use standard questionnaires like the SDQ for Depression Symptoms. To identify the symptoms like anxiety, anger, irritability, etc. that help identify depression, the SDQ uses a Likert 5 scale of various questions. With the development of machine learning and big data, we can now use additional data sources, such as social media, chats, and chatbots, to create a more thorough understanding of the signs of depression. This will give mental health professionals a more complete picture of symptoms and prevent the bias that naturally occurs when symptoms are reported because such conditions are stigmatized when they are self-reported in questionnaires.

The following issues are the main focus of this project:
* How can text and conversations on social media lessen the symptoms of depression?
* What machine learning (ML) methods are effective for identifying depression?
* How can intelligent chatbots aid in the diagnosis of mental health professionals?

In this project, I have discussed the following:
*	Evaluate depression symptoms using Machine Learning technique-Random Forest Classifier
*	Build a machine learning model to help power an intelligent chatbot to assist mental health  
professionals for diagnosing depression
